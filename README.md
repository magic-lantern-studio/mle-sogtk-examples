Coin3D examples using the SoGtk GUI

The mle-sogtk-examples project provides examples for Open Inventor programming using the Coin 3D SDK and SoGtk toolkit.
These examples were tested against older versions of Coin and SoGtk and may not be relavent to the current state of the
Coin 3D libraries.

A more comprehensive collection of examples may be found at [ivexamples](https://github.com/coin3d/ivexamples), which
are kept up to date with the latest Coin and SoGtk technology.

## Magic Lantern Dependencies

The Coin 3D library can be found on Github in the [coin project](https://github.com/magic-lantern-studio/coin)

The Coin SoGtk library is also located on Github under the [sogtk project](https://github.com/magic-lantern-studio/sogtk).
